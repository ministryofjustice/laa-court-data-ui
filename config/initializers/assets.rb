# WE ARE NOT USING sprockets/asset pipeline
#
# To enable you have to change
# 1. add require "sprockets/railtie" to ../config/application.rb
# 2. uncomment/cong=figure references assets in ../config/environments/<env>.rb
# 3. provide typical rails <= 4 assets dir structure
#
# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Version of your assets, change this if you want to expire all your assets.
# Rails.application.config.assets.version = '1.0'

# Add additional assets to the asset load path.
# Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Emoji.images_path
# Add Yarn node_modules folder to the asset load path.
# Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('node_modules')

# Precompile additional assets.
# application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS in the app/assets
# folder are already added.
# Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( admin.js admin.css )
